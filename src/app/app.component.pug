        h3 Where is hysoftware.net using Django?
      p.
        When I launched my website, I found the numper of people who contacted
        thru my website was very few and it means a website isn't really
        effective to receive job offers. In addition to this, even if I
        receive the offers, it seemed to be insincere.
      p.
        If you want to see the webapp, check
        #[a(href="https://github.com/hysoftware/hysoftware.net/tree/legacy-2018" target="_blank") this].

        h3 How to contact me
      p.
        If you want to contact me, use SNS or email me directly. The reason why
        I don't disclose my email address is to avoid insincere job scouts / offers.
        However, you can get my email address very easily as long as you are
        familar with this world.
