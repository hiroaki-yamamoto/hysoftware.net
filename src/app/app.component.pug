      p.
        When I launched my website, I found there's very few people who
        contacted me thru the web form of this website. i.e. Making a personal
        website isn't really effective to receive sincere job offers.
      p.
        If you want to see the webapp, check
        #[a(href="https://github.com/hysoftware/hysoftware.net/tree/legacy-2018" target="_blank") this].

        h3 How to contact me
      p.
        If you want to contact me, use SNS or email me directly. The reason why
        I don't disclose my email address is to avoid insincere job scouts / offers.
        However, you can get my email address very easily as long as you are
        familar with this world.
