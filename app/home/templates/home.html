  <h2>Transparency of Code</h2>
  <p>
    To check the qualities of the code, generally you can work with coders. <br>
    However, you will need to pay for it. <br>
    While this "weird situation", Hiroaki is working on Open-source software
    development as a volunteer not only business/proprietary software.

  <h2>Strategies</h2>
  <p>
    Estimating the delivery date on software industries is difficult.
    However, it is able to be estimated by spliting the software by modules,
    functionalities, tasks, etc...<br>
    After split, It needs to code a software to check whether the function
    works or not. <br>
    In addition, this process can be handled before coding actual
    apps as far as possible.<br>
    This is one of the feature of Agile Development and it is called TDD or
    BDD. <br> By writing tests against current behavior, the written tests
    guarantee the code works even if a new function is added.
