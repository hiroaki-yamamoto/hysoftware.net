  <h2>Transparency of Code</h2>

  <p>
    To check the qualities of the code, generally you can work with coders. <br>
    However, you will need to pay for it. <br>
    While this "weird situation", Hiroaki is working on Open-source software
    development as a volunteer not only business/proprietary software.

  <h2>Strategies</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>First step: test</h3>
    <div class="ion-android-checkbox-outline eyecatch"></div>
    <p>
      Estimating the delivery date on software industries is difficult.<br />
      However, it is able to be estimated by spliting the software by modules,
      functionalities, tasks, etc...<br>
      After split, It needs to code a software to check whether the function
      works or not. <br>
      In addition, this process can be handled before coding actual
      apps as far as possible.<br>
      This is one of the feature of Agile Development and it is called TDD or
      BDD. <br> By doing above, the written tests ensure that the code works
      even if the code is heavily-changed.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Second step: code</h3>
    <div class="ion-ios-bolt eyecatch"></div>
    <p>
      This is the most exciting part of coding. <br>
      Coders are feeling all-seeing and all-knowing while they are coding.<br>
      After the coding is finished, the goal of task is almost there!
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Final step: refactor</h3>
    <div class="ion-thumbsup eyecatch"></div>
    <p>
      The finished code is dirty, un-maintainable, but it just works. <br>
      This is why the code is written for passing tests, not for humans. <br>
      The code should be written for humans, therefore re-styling the code
      is needed.<br>
      This is just re-styling the code, and the behavior is not changed and
      it is guranteed by unit tests.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>After the refactoring, the task is finished!</strong></p>

    By repeating above steps, Hiro can code what your/your company's want.
